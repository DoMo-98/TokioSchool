# TokioSchool: Final Projects for AI, ML, and DL Specializations
This repository contains the final projects completed during my specializations in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) at TokioSchool.

## Content
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Projects focused on data cleaning, preprocessing, and using AI-based models to create applications.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Implementations of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** Advanced neural network models applied to real-world problems.

## Objective
The goal of this repository is to showcase the skills acquired during the specializations and to share knowledge with the community.
